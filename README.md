TOP recipes project. 

First project with TOP. Building a simple index homepage that will link to some recipes. I will be using the skills taught in the HTML foundations course of TOP.

Update: Finished Project! As you may have noticed, I like seafood. Here is the credit for the recipes:

I guess I put the home button in a unique place. I'm good with it. 

Btw, everyone else has great sites. Nice job on your fist project!
